## 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

### AirBnB clone project!

It's a clone of the AirBnB webapp

#### Command interpreter

Do you know the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

#### What our command interpreter can do:

* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
