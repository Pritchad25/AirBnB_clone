This directory contains the Web Static version of the AirBnB clone project. Previously I built a command interpreter for managing the  AirBnB objects. This Web Static project is to make those objects alive using HTML and CSS. While doing this project, I learnt:
-how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages
-How to create an HTML page
-What is a markup language
-What is the DOM
-What is an element / tag
-What is an attribute
-How a browser loads a webpage
-What is CSS
-How to add style to an element
-What is a class
-What is a selector
-How to compute CSS Specificity Value
